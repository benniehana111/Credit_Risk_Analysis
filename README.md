# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

This analysis uses machine learning to predict credit risk. We employ logistic regression, Balanced Random Forest, and Easy Ensemble classifiers to predict credit risk, based on a dataset on consumer credit risk containing 20 variables on consumer's debts, assets, available credit, and credit histories. Two address the class imbalance in the dataset (good loans greatly outnumber bad loans) we apply four different sampling algorithms to resample the dataset, train the classifier, calculate accuracy scores, generate confusion matrices, and generate imbalanced classification reports.
