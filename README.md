# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

This analysis uses machine learning to predict credit risk, testing the effectiveness of six different models. The first four models used logistic regression with four alternative sampling algorithms:

(1) Logistic regression w/RandomOverSampler  
(2) Logistic regression w/SMOTE  
(3) Logistic regression w/ClusterCentroids  
(4) Logistic regression w/SMOTEENN  

The last two models used ensemble classifiers:  

(5) Balanced Random Forest  
(6) Easy Ensemble Classifier  

These models are tested for their ability to predict credit risk, based on a dataset on consumer credit risk with 115,676 observations, containing over 100 variables on consumer's debts, assets, available credit, and credit histories. For each of these six models we calculate accuracy scores, generate confusion matrices, and imbalanced classification reports.
